Integrated Retail Analytics for Store Optimization
📌 Project Summary

The Integrated Retail Analytics for Store Optimization project addresses the challenges of modern retail management using machine learning and data-driven insights.
The project focuses on optimizing store performance, detecting anomalies in sales data, forecasting demand, and enhancing customer experience through segmentation and personalized marketing.

It combines three major datasets — store-level details, weekly sales records, and external features — into a unified analytics solution.

🎯 Problem Statement

Retailers face fluctuating consumer demand, competition, and external pressures (e.g., economic indicators, fuel prices, unemployment). Traditional approaches often fail to handle anomalies and predict trends effectively.

This project aims to:

Detect unusual sales patterns and anomalies.

Forecast weekly demand using ML models.

Segment customers and stores for better strategy.

Develop actionable insights for store optimization.

🛠️ Tools and Techniques

Machine Learning: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Time-Series Forecasting & Anomaly Detection

Clustering & Market Basket Analysis

Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Statistical Testing: Hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA, correlation)

Visualization: 15+ charts for trends, seasonal patterns, and insights

📊 Deliverables

✅ A detailed notebook with analysis, insights, and recommendations

✅ Predictive models for sales forecasting and anomaly detection

✅ Segmentation analysis and market basket insights

✅ Code and 15+ visualizations to support findings

✅ Hypothesis testing with business interpretations

⚡ Results & Insights

Compared Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost → Random Forest & XGBoost performed better with lower RMSE and higher R²

Seasonal patterns (holidays, fuel prices, unemployment rate) strongly influence sales

Anomaly detection identified outliers during promotions and holiday weeks

Customer segmentation allows for targeted marketing and optimized inventory management
